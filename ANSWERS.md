- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?
class components have more functionality like state and lifecycle methods that function components did not pre-hooks

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.
Birthg/mounthg: when the component is being built. initial setup of data
Growing/Updating: when data is being uodated, state set & component re-renders(or doesnt)
Death/Unmount: component unmounts, any clean up for outside events performed.

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?
-for more DRY/reusable code. can manage beahvior/stateful logic & be able to re-use the hook instead of having to re-write the same code.

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?
Testing allows us to trust the code. minimizes bugs that make it to production, helps us to write cleaner(more testable) code & helps us think about edge cases.
